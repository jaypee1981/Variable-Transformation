TRANSFORMATION OF VARIABLES

Data do not always come in a form that is immediately suitable for analysis. We often have to transform the variables before carrying out the analysis. In some instances it can help us better examine a distribution.

OBJECTIVES
 To achieve normality.
 To stabilize the variance.
 To ensure linearity.
